    <p> My name is Lana and I welcome you to my website. </p>
    <p> I am in the eighth grade, but I am fourteen and a half years old already. Which means I am supposed to be a high school freshman, but that's okay. <div> It's great to be a few months to a year older than everyone else in my grade. Especially when I turn eighteen years old in less than four years, I'll still be in high school, twelfth grade, to be specific. I'll be able to drive my friends around whenever I can! When I start my first year in high school next year, I'd be just turning fifteen years old, so I'll be able to start learning how to drive shortly after I start school. I'll probably be able to get my driver's permit by seventeen.</div></p>
  <p> The reason I am a little older than everyone is because I am profoundly deaf in both ears with Cochlear implants for both ears. When I was a toddler, I had to get surgeries, check-ups, et cetera, which made me a year behind. To paraphrase, I started a little later.</p>
